# Kermie - Defcon 2023 Frog Badge
![Badge PCB](/Gerber%20Files/pcb_image.png)

### Announcement
> We've heard reports of some badges not behaving properly and losing their unlocked Frogs when powered off. We're very sorry your adopted Frogs have not lived up to your expectations. In response, we've decided to release the source code as well as the steps to unlock all frogs on the badge. Simply place `wednesday.jpg` on the root of your Frog's SD card to unlock all frogs. Thanks for your support this year and we're happy our Frogs all have a good home!

-Sam and Nikki

### I've erased or messed with my SD card
If you've erased your badge's SD card and need to reinitialize, format as `FAT32` and copy the contents of the [Media Folder](/Media) to a directory named `img` on the root of your SD card.
